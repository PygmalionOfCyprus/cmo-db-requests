        Thank you for taking the time to request a new ship.

        ### On Class Requests
        If you're requesting an entire class of ship rather than a specific vessel, please fill out the form as if for the class nameship. For example, if requesting the Arleigh Burke-class, fill out the form as if for DDG-51.

        If the class saw significant changes/blocks/flights/etc., it may be worth filing separate requests to cover these differences. Please fill out the follow-on forms as if for the block/flight nameship. For example, if requesting a Flight II Arleigh Burke-class, fill out the form as if for DDG-72.

        ### On Multinational Vessels
        Be cautious filing single requests for ships in the service of multiple countries. Most ships are sold with different fittings or refit on transfer; these changes often warrant separate requests.

        When was the *class* in service?
        
        If requesting a specific vessel, this will match the vessel's service dates. If requesting a class (and therefore modelling a nameship), the out-of-service date may be much later than the nameship's decommissioning.
