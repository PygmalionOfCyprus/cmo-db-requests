        Thank you for taking the time to request a new sub.

        ### On Class Requests
        If you're requesting an entire class of sub rather than a specific vessel, please fill out the form as if for the class nameship. For example, if requesting the Virginia-class, fill out the form as if for SSN-774.

        If the class saw significant changes/blocks/flights/etc., it may be worth filing separate requests to cover these differences. Please fill out the follow-on forms as if for the block/flight nameship. For example, if requesting the Flight II Virginia-class, fill out the form as if for SSN-778.

        When was the *class* in service?
        
        If requesting a specific vessel, this will match the vessel's service dates. If requesting a class (and therefore modelling a nameship), the out-of-service date may be much later than the nameship's decommissioning.
