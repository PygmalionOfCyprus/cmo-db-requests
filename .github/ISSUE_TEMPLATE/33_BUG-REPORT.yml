        Thank you for bringing our attention to a bug! This form is similar to the update request form, but will attract more attention from the devs.

        Only use this form for things which are actually *broken*: i.e., they don't work, or are so significantly screwed up that they make gameplay impossible. For example: a SAM site that can't target aircraft.
        
        Typos, inaccurate entries, etc. should be reported via a normal update request.
