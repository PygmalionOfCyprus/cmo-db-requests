      description: Is this for DB3K, CWDB, or both?
      multiple: false
      options:

      description: |
        Is there is an aircraft in the DB you recommend we start from? This is different from a "Copy Entry" in that most of its values will be changed, but we can use this to estimate anything we aren't sure of.

        For example, a Boeing 777 is different enough from a 747 that we couldn't simply copy one to make the other -- but it's a fair starting point.
