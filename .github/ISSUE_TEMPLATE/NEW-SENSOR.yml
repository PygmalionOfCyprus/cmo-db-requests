        Thank you for taking the time to request a new sensor. Although *Command* models a wide variety of sensor types, this form is only intended for use with radar and sonar. Other sensors are simple enough to model that they will never require a separate subcomponent request (see below).

        ### A Note on Requesting Subcomponents
        Subcomponents -- such as weapons and sensors -- are of little use without a host. While it is true that weapon records / sensors may be added to various platforms in the mission editor, a weapon/sensor that is not currently employed on any platform in the DB is rarely worth the time it takes to add.

        If the weapon/sensor *is* employed on another platform but not represented in the DB, it may be better to file an addition, update, or loadout request instead. If we need you to file a separate subcomponent request, we'll let you know.
