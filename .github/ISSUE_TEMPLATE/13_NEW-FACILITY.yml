      # ### Facility or Ground Unit?
      # As a rule of thumb, if the system is defined by the effect it has *on other domains*, it's probably best modelled as a facility. A SAM system, for example, is meant to engage targets in the air; a coastal defense missile battery is intended to engage targets at sea; this despite both technically being land-based platforms.

      # Modelling as a Ground Unit is more appropriate for land combat vehicles, i.e. vehicles whose primary purpose is to spot, engage, and destroy other targets on land or otherwise influence operations in that domain. Tanks, APCs/IFVs, trucks, and cars are all examples of vehicles best modelled in the Ground Units annex.
