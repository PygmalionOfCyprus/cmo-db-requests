        This form can be used to request an addition when an identical base platform already exists in the DB.

        For example, if a new country acquires the F-35, you don't need to file a "New Aircraft" request and supply information such as length, width, etc. -- we already have that in the DB, and can simply copy an extant entry.

        What we *do* need is the differences: sensor swaps, weapons fit, etc. And that's where this form comes in...
